This project is an attempt to translate the structure of the Open Wonderland project into Maven.

The original project is built using ant scripts, and it's tied to the Netbeans IDE. This project intends to be IDE independent.

Other goals are:
	- Speed up the build process
	- Be able to build modules without the need of having the core sources
	- Reduce memory usage in the build process
	- Manage dendencies
	- Create an archetype for Modules
